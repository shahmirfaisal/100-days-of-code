# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 17, 2020.

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a corona virus tracker app.

**Thoughts:** I saw an Api for corona virus at github which motivated me to create web app for that.I created it with React.js .

### Day 2: March 18, 2020.

**Today's Progress**: I learned some basics of node.js. Created a server and send a simple response.

**Thoughts:** I've learned front end and now I'm focusing on backend development with node.js. And It's really tricky for me to understand Node.js basics.
